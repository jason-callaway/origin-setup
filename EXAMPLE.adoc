= OpenShift Service on AWS EC2
Mark Lamourine

== Deployment

In addition to the OpenShift broker and nodes, the OpenShift service
depends on several back-end services.  The DNS service will use the
AWS Route53 service. In a small installation such as this it is
possible to run the MongoDB data store and the ActiveMQ messaging on
the same host, but I'll resist the temptation to better illustrate the
distinctions between the services.
